[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andrewmcodes/example-change.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andrewmcodes/example-change)

Sometimes your `.example` files change and you may never know. This gem will let you know if your config files and your .example file for that config are not in sync.

## TODOS

- [] create release binstub
- [] release should update release-notes

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'example-change'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install example-change

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
